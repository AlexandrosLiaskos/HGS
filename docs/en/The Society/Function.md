The society is governed by a twelve-member Board of Directors. Its members are elected every two years at the General Assembly by the regular, financially up-to-date members through secret ballot.

The General Assembly also elects six alternate board members to replace resigned or deceased regular members, in order corresponding to the number of votes received in the election.
