# History

The Hellenic Geographical Society (HGS) is a non-governmental, non-profit scientific, educational and professional society founded in 1928 devoted to the development of the discipline of Geography. For more than 90 years the HGS and its members have contributed to the advancement of geography.

The purposes of the HGS are primarily to promote Geography through initiating and coordinating geographical research and teaching in Greece. Its work is conducted through members and National Committees. The HGS hosts the International Conference of the Hellenic Geographical Society every two years and also promotes other meetings that comply with the objectives of the Society. The HGS also facilitates the participation of geographers in the global community of scientists through its formal affiliation as a Member within both the International Geographical Union (IGU) and the Association of European Geographers (EUROGEO) and the Association of Geographical Societies in Europe (EUGEO).

Since its founding in 1928, the HGS's dedicated people, strong intellectual base, and vision have helped to serve the professional needs of geographers and to advance geography. With your continued support, we are poised to continue that role into the next century.
