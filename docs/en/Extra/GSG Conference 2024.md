| **Reach**                                               | International conference. We should try to coordinate with ongoing European or international projects and any potential meetings they have during the conference period to increase international participation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Publication of Proceedings**                          | Conference proceedings online (e-proceedings). Special issue in the European Journal of Geography. A team involving young scientists, supported by Mr. Koutsopoulos, will undertake this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Finances**                                            | Fees should be low to attract participants. We propose: €60 standard fee / €40 for members / €20 for students / €10 for student members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Invited Speakers and Keynote Speakers**               | The cost might be prohibitive; let's review potential names. It's better to decide later (in June) based on participation levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **General Assembly Meeting & Board Election**           | To be added to the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
